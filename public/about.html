<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Shireen Shaikh — a curious mind with a passion for solving problems, telling data-driven stories, and building things that matter. </p>
<p>With a background in mechanical engineering and a strong foundation in biology and data science, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to everything I do. I’ve worked on projects ranging from molecular toxicity prediction and climate data analysis to interactive dashboards and full-stack development. Whether it’s through code, research, or creative exploration, I’m always looking for new ways to learn, contribute, and create impact.
</p>
<p>I’m currently sharpening my skills in machine learning, web development, and systems design while preparing for an upcoming internship at Uber. I thrive on challenges, believe in lifelong learning, and love collaborating with people who are as driven and curious as I am.
</p>
<p>When I'm not working on a project, you'll probably find me mentoring students, exploring complex problems in science and tech, or diving into a new idea with a notebook and lots of coffee.</p>
